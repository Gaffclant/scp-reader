# scp-reader
Read the SCP wiki from the terminal!

## Requirements
You need python 3.9 (I haven't tested with lower versions) and the packages in `requirements.txt`

## Install
I havent made a way to realistically *install* the script, but you can download the .py and run it just fine with the commands below

```
git clone https://github.com/Gaffclant/scp-reader.git
cd scp-reader
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## Commands
```
help            list of commands
r               random scp
<scp-number>    specified scp
save            save scp data to <scp-number>.txt
logout          quit the program
```
